		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<br>
		<nav id="nav01"></nav> 
		<p>I am a student in the UWT MSGT program 2017-18. In this program we will be examining
		different mapping technologies, and applying them to real world problems.</p>
		<br>
                <p>In the past, I competed in the 2015 URISA National GIS-PRO undergraduate skills competition. 
                That experience was exceptional for teaching me about academia and conference presentation skills. I am hoping to continue 
                the trend and present more of my work as I proceed through the MSGT program</p>
                <br>
                <p>This summer I welcomed a new addition to my family!</p>
